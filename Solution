some time you just get ban by the game bugs or the server problem that will be fixed in few days but if it didn't go for the second line  
if you actually did some action or the first line didn't worked for you you can try your luck by abusing the ban appeal
now this solution required a fast action after the ban and some information like the date of your account creation or the purchase you did and some more 
but remember you have to ritedown the reason of your ban "i was hacked" this is the only way you get Chance to get unban by the easy anti cheat 
of course its not gonna work every time but in my research if you do the ban apleal fast and give enough information to the admin you have the chance of 40% to get unban 
in your first try how ever this method will work only if you didn't get any warnings or ban before
